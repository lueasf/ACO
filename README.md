# Geometric Optimization with CVXPY and ECOS

This project demonstrates how to solve geometric optimization problems using convex programming.

> It finds the extreme point of a convex shape (e.g., diamond) that maximizes projection along a specified direction.

## ECOS
ECOS (Embedded Conic Solver) is an open-source solver, designed for SOCP (Second Order Cone Programming) and SDP (Semidefinite Programming).
